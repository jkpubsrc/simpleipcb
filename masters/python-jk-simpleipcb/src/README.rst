jk_simpleipcb
=============

This module provides a way to attach other processes (possibly written in other programming languages) to the current python process in order to use functionality provided in these other processes.

Communication is performed by exchanging data frames over pipes. Processes attached can receive these frames, perform some tasks and then respond with a response data frame. As these frames can be of almost arbitrary size even exchanging larger amount of data is well supported.
